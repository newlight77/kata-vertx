## Vert.x demo project

This project show how to build a micro-service with vert.x providing a
simple todo resource.


### Build
The build.gradle uses the Gradle shadowJar plugin to assemble the
application and all itâ€™s dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build the "fat jar"

```
./gradlew shadowJar


```


### Run

To run the application

```
./gradlew run


```

or launch

```
java -jar build/libs/vertx-demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar

```


### Test it

Go to the http://localhost:8082/todos


### Configuration

Default configuration below :

```
{
  "http.port": 8082,

  "vertxOptions": {
    "clustered": true,
    "clusterHost": "127.0.0.1",
    "quorumSize": 1,
    "haEnabled": true,
    "haGroup": "todos",
    "eventLoopPoolSize": 4,
    "workerPoolSize": 4
  }
}

```


You can override that configuration by throwing in the override-config property.


### More verticles

To embbed more verticles :

* Implement a class extends AbstractVerticle (see TodoVerticle)
* add verticle config in verticles-config.json as below

{
{
  "verticles" : [
    {
      "class" : "com.newlight77.demo.vertx.verticle.TodoVerticle",
      "deploymentOptions": {
        "config": {
        },
        "instances": 1,
        "ha": true,
